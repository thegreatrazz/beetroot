# Beetroot Shared Music Player
Beetroot is a "boombox" sort-of software which allows you and the members of your group to
queue and play music.

At this point in time, it's the early concept and development stage. But it will (hopefully) become something
useful in the future.

> This is the desktop app. The server component is at [beetroot-server](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/beetroot-server).
